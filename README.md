# BuildAI â€” No-Code Website Builder

**Live demo:** [https://buildai-no-code-plat-siy0.bolt.host/](https://buildai-no-code-plat-siy0.bolt.host/)

A modern, drag-and-drop no-code website builder aimed at non-technical entrepreneurs.  
BuildAI combines an intuitive visual site builder with AI-assisted content generation and a simple e-commerce dashboard â€” all shipped as a frontend-focused app using **localStorage** for persistence (no external DB required).

## ðŸ”Ž Overview
BuildAI is a TypeScript + React + Vite single-page app that provides:

- a **drag-and-drop page builder** to create pages visually  
- **AI-assisted content generation** for headings, copy and images (integrated prompts / local mock)  
- an **E-commerce dashboard** to add/manage products and orders  
- **persistence using localStorage** (mock seed data included)  
- **lightweight animations** and polish using Framer Motion  

ðŸ‘‰ The app intentionally avoids any remote database or hosted backend â€” everything is stored locally so you can run it offline or deploy a static build.

## ðŸ“¦ Seeding & data persistence
BuildAI uses **localStorage** to store sites, products, and orders.  

- On first run, if no data exists, it loads seed data (see `src/lib/seed.ts`).  
- Use **Export** to download your site JSON and **Import** to restore it.  
- To reset state manually, run in browser console:

```js
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
